# Introduction

Wouldn't it be great if you can write an academic paper using markdown instead of latex?
I present markademic, a pipeline for creating an academic paper-style pdf from a markdown file!

# Approach

1. convert markdown to tex using [remark-latex](https://github.com/Paperist/remark-latex)
2. convert tex to pdf using [pdflatex](https://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/)
3. update tex and pdf on-the-fly using [npm-watch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-watch)

# Result

| Didn't | do  | experiment |
|--------|-----|------------|
| N/A    | N/A | N/A        |

# Conclusion

Try writing your next paper with markademic
